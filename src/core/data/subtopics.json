    "summary": "Ants rely on a wide range of foods to fuel their colonies, from sweet liquids to protein-rich meals. Their feeding is guided by both instinct and chemical signals, allowing them to detect nutritious sources and communicate their locations to other colony members. Different species have evolved unique strategies to acquire and process food, from foraging individually or in teams to cultivating fungus gardens. Antsâ€™ diets support not only their energy needs but also the production of pheromones, enzymes, and other chemicals that keep the colony healthy and coordinated.",

Visual communication, though less common, occurs in species with well-developed eyes that use body postures and movements to convey information during recruitment or territorial disputes.",

Fungus-growing ants cultivate specialized fungi in underground gardens, feeding them with fresh plant material and maintaining optimal growing conditions through temperature regulation and pest control. Plant-ant mutualisms create living fortresses where plants provide shelter and food rewards in exchange for aggressive defense against herbivores. Some ants harbor endosymbiotic bacteria that produce essential nutrients or antibiotics, while others exploit relationships as social parasites that infiltrate host colonies.",

Visual landmark learning supplements dead reckoning, with experienced ants developing detailed cognitive maps of their foraging areas based on panoramic snapshots of surrounding features. Olfactory landmarks, including pheromone trails laid by previous foragers, create chemical roadmaps that guide nestmates to resources. Some species use polarized light patterns in the sky as a compass, while others employ magnetic field detection or measure distance through step counting, demonstrating the remarkable navigational sophistication packed into tiny brains.",

Colony founding typically begins with nuptial flights where winged males and virgin queens leave their natal nests to mate in the air, after which mated queens shed their wings and search for suitable nest sites. During the claustral founding phase, queens seal themselves in chambers and rely entirely on metabolized wing muscles and fat reserves to produce the first generation of workers without foraging. As worker numbers increase, colonies transition through growth phases with shifting investment in worker production, nest expansion, and eventually reproductive output. Mature colonies produce new queens and males in seasonal reproductive events, completing the cycle while the original colony may persist for decades through queen replacement or continue until the founding queen's death.",
