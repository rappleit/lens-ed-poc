    "title": "Ant Diet",
    "summary": "Ants rely on a wide range of foods to fuel their colonies, from sweet liquids to protein-rich meals. Their feeding is guided by both instinct and chemical signals, allowing them to detect nutritious sources and communicate their locations to other colony members. Different species have evolved unique strategies to acquire and process food, from foraging individually or in teams to cultivating fungus gardens. Antsâ€™ diets support not only their energy needs but also the production of pheromones, enzymes, and other chemicals that keep the colony healthy and coordinated.",

Different subspecies live in different regions, each adapted to its own environment, but all face similar threats from poaching and habitat loss.",
