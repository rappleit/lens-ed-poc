      "summary": "Ants are social insects belonging to the family Formicidae, known for living in highly organized colonies with specialized roles such as queens, workers, and soldiers. With more than 15,000 species worldwide, they thrive in nearly every ecosystem, where they play vital roles as decomposers, seed dispersers, and ecological engineers. Their success stems from cooperative behavior, complex communication, and the ability to build both underground and above-ground nests.",

      "summary": "The Malayan tiger is a critically endangered subspecies of tiger found in the tropical forests of the Malay Peninsula. Smaller than other tiger subspecies, it has a muscular build, distinctive orange coat with black stripes, and remarkable agility that allows it to hunt effectively in dense jungle terrain. Malayan tigers are solitary predators, feeding on deer, wild boar, and other medium-sized mammals, and they play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems. Threats such as habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict have drastically reduced their population, making conservation efforts vital to ensure their survival.",
