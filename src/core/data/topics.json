      "summary": "Ants are social insects belonging to the family Formicidae, known for living in highly organized colonies with specialized roles such as queens, workers, and soldiers. With more than 15,000 species worldwide, they thrive in nearly every ecosystem, where they play vital roles as decomposers, seed dispersers, and ecological engineers. Their success stems from cooperative behavior, complex communication, and the ability to build both underground and above-ground nests.",
